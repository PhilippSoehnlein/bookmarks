You will be send to the update page, the update throws some Errors, but nothing serious.
Bookmarks work again! All my old bookmarks, I carry around since OC 5 are still there and lived happy after.

May the source be with you!

CAVEEAT: The integrity check on the bookmarks app will fail, but it will work nonetheless. I do not know how to correct this issue, sorry.

## Using the Bookmarks App
The Bookmark application allows you to bookmark Web sites inside ownCloud.

### The main interface
#### Add a bookmark
In the Bookmark application, enter a URL into the top-left area of the content section. After adding an address, click on the pencil button to edit fields for the given address. The main ownCloud bookmark interface contains 3 fields at the top where you can enter the website address (or URL), the title of your bookmark, and a set of tags separated from each other by a space.

#### Edit/Delete a bookmark
You also have the possibility to edit or delete a bookmark.

To edit a bookmark, hover over the bookmark and click on the pencil icon. The bookmark details will then be filled into the 3 fields at the top of the screen. Modify your bookmark to your needs then click the save button to persist the change.

To delete a bookmark, hover over the bookmark and click the cross icon.

#### Search
If you click on a tag, ownCloud will only display the bookmarks that are described with this tag.

You can also use the search bar of ownCloud in the top right of your screen.

Simply click on the “Bookmarks” menu in the sidebar to come back to the default view.

### The Bookmarklet
The creator of this app understands that people won’t want to open the ownCloud boorkmarks page to add a bookmark every time they see a cool site. This is why they have made this cool “bookmarklet”.

A bookmarklet is small button that you can drag and drop in your bookmarks. The next time you see a cool new site, click on this special bookmark to add the site to your ownCloud bookmarks.

To find this bookmark, click on the gear button at the bottom of the bookmarks app.

## Developer setup info

### Installation

Just clone this repo into one of your apps directory.

### Status
Rewrite by [Stefan Klemm] aka ganomi (https://github.com/ganomi)

- This is a refactored / rewritten version of the bookmarks app using the app framework
- Dependency Injection for user and db is used througout the controllers
- The Routing features a consistent rest api
- The Routing provides some legacy routes, so that for exampe the Android Bookmarks App still works.
- Merged all the changes from https://github.com/owncloud/bookmarks/pull/68 and added visual fixes. App uses the App Framework Styling on the Client side now.
- There is a publicly available api that provides access to bookmarks per user. (This is usefull in connection with the Wordpress Plugin https://github.com/mario-nolte/oc2wp-bookmarks)

### Public Rest Api (JSON Formatting)

#### Example Url
```
../apps/bookmarks/public/rest/v1/bookmark?user=username&password=password&tags[]=firsttag&tags[]=anothertag&select[]=description&conjunction=AND&sortby=description
```

#### Parameters
- user is a mandatory parameter. This will return all bookmarks from the specific user marked as public. (not yet possible!)
- by providing the users password all bookmarks will be returned
- tags[] can take multiple arguments and they are used to filter the requested bookmarks by tags
- conjunction (default = or) sets the tag filter to OR or to AND
- select[] takes multiple arguments. By default only url and title per bookmark are returned. Further you can select any attribute of the bookmarks table and also the attribute "tags"
- sortby takes and attribute that results will be sorted by descending.
